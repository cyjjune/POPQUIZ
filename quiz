Inheritance: When you extend a super class, the sub-class automatically inherit the fields and the public methods insides the 
super class. This feature saves us a lot of time when we are programming.

Polymorphism: Two objects related by inheritance can have methods with the same name in different ways. Which object invokes a 
method decides which version of the method to use.
